# VR-Cardiomics

## Overview

VR-Cardiomics provides a framework to map multi-dimensional data (such as intensity and location of gene expression) on to 3D models in a heatmap-like manner. In our use case the intensity is the level of gene expression of those expressed in the adult heart, and the location is this expression level in 18 discrete pieces of the heart as measured by RNA-seq.

VR-Cardiomics is designed to map user generated data onto a user specific 3D model. However, the data and the model must meet certain requirements. Please refer to the chapter #Upload Custom Data for more information on how to use VR-cardiomics as a framework for own data and models on your local machine.

This application supports VR devices as listed below, our [Web applicatipn](https://github.com/Ramialison-Lab/3DCardiomics) and [zSpace](https://github.com/Ramialison-Lab/3DCardiomicsZSpace) are available as well.
